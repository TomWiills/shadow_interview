- Ensure you have a docker image for the scripts/packages you require
- write a unit test
- we want to filter the noisy data 
- then we want to detect the change in y in a certain timeframe, 
- if it is over a certain value we need to apply a filter to smooth it
- the smoothing looks like it should occur in a 0.25 window so apply smoothing +/- 0.125
- the gaussian with jumps test name implies a gaussian filter may need to be used
- trying to detect a change in y will be too difficult with noisy data
- time (x values of the data should not be changed)

Action plan

- find out what frequency the data is recorded at and calculate how many data points we can edit in a 0.125 window
- decide which filter to pass the noisy data through
- decide on a the delta of y that will trigger a smoothing event
- decide on the smoothing function to use 
- implement a function to get the new y values, from the smoothed curve, using the fixed x values
- create a function to graph the end result.
- implement a few unit tests (test known delta y values and the outcomes)
